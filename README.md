# Flood_Fill_Challenge
## A recursive algorithm akin to the flood fill feature in MS Paint.

### Requirements:
Python 3

### Instrucitons:

Run this file via terminal with Python 3. 


An image is represented by an m x n integer grid image where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image. Provid the script with a grid row and column and an integer which represents a new color value. This script performs a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc] which means every cell of the same value as the given cell will be replaced with the new value as long as it is connected virtically or hoizontally to a cell that is being changed starting with the given cell.

A modified image is returned after performing the flood fill.

A sample image grid is provided at the bottom of the file.
